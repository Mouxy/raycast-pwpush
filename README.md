A Raycat extension for PwPush - https://pwpush.com

It works only for passwords and works for the "public" PwPush offer as well as paid or self-hosted.
At first start you are asked for the URL and API key, if nothing is provided, the extension will use the default https://pwpush.com

### TO Install
Download the package as a zip and extract (the files will remain there, so maybe chose a "final" destination)
Open Raycast and type "Import Extension"
Select the folder
You should be able to use the command "pwpush"
